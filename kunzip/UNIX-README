If you'd like to build the libkunzip.so library for Linux/FreeBSD/Unix etc,
type: make lib

This should create a libkunzip.so which you will need to copy into one
of your lib directories, probably /usr/local/lib

On a Linux system you will then need to type: ldconfig
otherwise the operating system will not know you copied the library
there.

If you still have problems with the library not being found, you
may have to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to point
to the directory where the libkunzip.so library exists or play with
your /etc/ld.so.conf file.

You can then copy the kunzip.h file to /usr/local/include

There is an example program how to use the library at:
